Welcome to GaterData
====================

Thankyou for downloading GaterData, and welcome to a great open-source API community.

GaterData allows you to define API's using only YAML or JSON to create a resource definition and the admin panel.

Unlike other API's, GaterData allows you to define logic and processing of data without any coding.
At a base level, programming can be reduced to semantic block, like 'for each', "while", "do this", "do that", etc.
