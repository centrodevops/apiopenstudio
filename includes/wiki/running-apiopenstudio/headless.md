Headless
========

It is perfectly reasonable to want to deploy ApiOpenStudio as a headless
application.

This is why the admin area has been kept separate from the core code.

All core resources are available in ApiOpenStudio (
see [Core resources](/running-apiopenstudio/core-resources.html)). This means
that you can do all of the operations that you can through admin, such as:

* Create/read/update/delete accounts.
* Create/read/update/delete applications.
* Create/read/update/delete users.
* Create/read/update/delete roles.
* Create/read/update/delete user roles.
* Create/read/update/delete variables.
* Create/read/update/delete resources.
* Create/read/update/delete invites.
* login
