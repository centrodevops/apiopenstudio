Creating and working on issues
==============================

To work on issues, you must `Request Access` to the repository.

This will give you access to the issue tickets.

Visit the [ApiOpenStudio][gitlab] home page, and click on the `Request Access`
link:

The maintainer will review and grant you `Reporter access`. You will then be
able to create, edit and assign tickets, and create merge requests.

### Reporting an issue

Visit the [ApiOpenStudio issue tracker][issues].

Ensure that your issue is not already reported.

If not, click on "New Issue" to open a new issue.

Add a meaningful Title, and as much information as you can in the Description,
with supporting files.

Submit the issue.

### Assign an issue

Visit [ApiOpenStudio issue tracker][issues] and assign a ticket to yourself
